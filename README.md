This is NOT an accusation.
If a defender has a card in your suggestion, they have to show you the card. 
Each defender can only show you ONE card, if they have more than one.
* Note: ONLY the three people you named as defenders can show you cards from your suggestion.

## Making an Accusation
When you are ready to make an accusation, grab Ina, and go to her laptop.
You'll step outside, and she'll provide you with your accusation opportunity.

If you are WRONG, your cards become public domain.

If you are CORRECT, you WIN!!!
